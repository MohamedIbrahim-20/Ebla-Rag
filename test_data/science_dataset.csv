Photosynthesis,Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll. During this process plants convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen using light energy. This process is fundamental to life on Earth as it produces oxygen and forms the base of most food chains.
DNA Structure,DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries genetic instructions for the development functioning growth and reproduction of all known living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix. The structure was discovered by Watson Crick Franklin and Wilkins and revolutionized our understanding of heredity.
Theory of Evolution,The Theory of Evolution by natural selection proposed by Charles Darwin explains how species change over time through the process of natural selection. Organisms with favorable traits are more likely to survive and reproduce passing these traits to their offspring. This process leads to the gradual change of species over generations.
Quantum Mechanics,Quantum Mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level. It introduces concepts like wave-particle duality uncertainty principle and quantum entanglement. These principles have led to technologies like lasers transistors and quantum computers.
Relativity Theory,Einstein's Theory of Relativity consists of special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity deals with objects moving at constant speeds in straight lines while general relativity explains gravity as the curvature of spacetime. These theories revolutionized our understanding of space time and gravity.
Cell Biology,Cell Biology is the study of cells their structure function and behavior. Cells are the basic units of life and can be prokaryotic (without nucleus) or eukaryotic (with nucleus). Understanding cellular processes like mitosis meiosis and cellular respiration is crucial for advances in medicine and biotechnology.
Genetics,Genetics is the study of genes heredity and genetic variation in living organisms. It explains how traits are passed from parents to offspring through DNA. Modern genetics includes molecular genetics population genetics and genomics which have applications in medicine agriculture and evolutionary biology.
Ecology,Ecology is the study of interactions between organisms and their environment. It examines how living things interact with each other and with their physical surroundings. Key concepts include ecosystems food webs biodiversity and conservation. Understanding ecology is crucial for environmental protection and sustainability.
Neuroscience,Neuroscience is the study of the nervous system including the brain spinal cord and networks of neurons throughout the body. It combines biology psychology chemistry and physics to understand how the nervous system functions. Research in neuroscience helps us understand consciousness memory learning and neurological disorders.
Climate Science,Climate Science is the study of Earth's climate system including the atmosphere hydrosphere cryosphere and biosphere. It examines long-term weather patterns climate change and the factors that influence global and regional climates. This field is crucial for understanding and addressing climate change challenges.
