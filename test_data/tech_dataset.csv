Artificial Intelligence,Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that work and react like humans. AI systems can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence such as visual perception speech recognition decision-making and translation between languages. Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
Machine Learning,Machine Learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Common algorithms include linear regression decision trees neural networks and support vector machines.
Deep Learning,Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data. It has revolutionized fields like computer vision natural language processing and speech recognition. Popular frameworks include TensorFlow PyTorch and Keras.
Natural Language Processing,Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. It involves programming computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. Applications include chatbots language translation sentiment analysis and text summarization.
Computer Vision,Computer Vision is a field of AI that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models machines can accurately identify and classify objects and then react to what they see. Applications include facial recognition autonomous vehicles and medical imaging.
Cloud Computing,Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services including servers storage databases networking software analytics and intelligence over the Internet to offer faster innovation flexible resources and economies of scale. Major providers include Amazon Web Services Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform.
Cybersecurity,Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems networks and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing changing or destroying sensitive information extorting money from users or interrupting normal business processes. Key areas include network security application security and data protection.
Blockchain Technology,Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records called blocks which are linked and secured using cryptography. It enables secure peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries. Applications include cryptocurrencies supply chain management and smart contracts.
Internet of Things,The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of physical objects embedded with sensors software and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet. Applications include smart homes industrial automation and healthcare monitoring.
Quantum Computing,Quantum Computing is a type of computation that harnesses the collective properties of quantum states such as superposition interference and entanglement to perform calculations. It has the potential to solve certain computational problems much faster than classical computers especially in cryptography optimization and simulation.
